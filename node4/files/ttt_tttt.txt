Retrieves the <fs.Stats> for the symbolic link referred to by the path. The callback gets two arguments (err, stats) where stats is a <fs.Stats> object. lstat() is identical to stat(), except that
if path is a symbolic link, then the link itself is stat-ed, not the file that it refers to.
See the POSIX lstat(2) documentation for more details.
